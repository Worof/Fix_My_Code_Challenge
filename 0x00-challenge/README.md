# 0x00 Challenge

Welcome to the `0x00-challenge` directory, a part of the Fix My Code Challenge series. This directory focuses on common coding challenges and bugs that new programmers often encounter. Our goal is to help you understand these issues and learn how to fix them efficiently.

## Project Description

This project contains various small programs, each designed to illustrate a specific coding challenge or bug. These challenges range from algorithmic problems to syntax errors and logical mistakes. By exploring these examples, you'll gain insight into debugging processes and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Files in the Directory

- `0-fizzbuzz.py`: A Python script that implements the FizzBuzz game, with a bug that needs to be identified and fixed.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to use the files.

## Installation
